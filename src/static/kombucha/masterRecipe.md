# Ingredients
|            | 1 quart crock  | 1 gallon crock |
|----------- | --------------:| --------------: |
| Water    |    3.5 cups   |  14 cups |
| Tea Bags* | 5 | 18 |
| Evaporated Cane Sugar | 1/4 cup | 1 cup |
| Kombucha | 1/2 cup | 2 cups |
| SCOBY | 1 fist wide | 2 fists wide |

*Green tea is the most popular. Black or white tea will be great too.

**Try your best to find...**
- spring or distilled water instead of tap water
- organic, fair trade tea
- organic, fair trade evaporated cane sugar
- organic, local kombucha

However, if you can't find any of those, don't worry! Your SCOBY will be fine, and you kombucha will still taste amazing.

# Prep
First, take half of your water and put it in the refrigerator. We'll use this later to cool down our tea. Make sure your thermometer, strainer, spoon, and pot are clean. If you're using tea bags, open them up so you can quickly throw them in the water.

# Brew the Tea
Pour the other half of the water into the pot and start heating on the stove. Keep the thermometer nearby. The steeping temperature and steeping time will depend on the kind of tea you are using.

|  | Steeping Temperature | Steeping Time |
|-----|:----:|:---:|
| Black Tea | 212° F | 5 minutes |
| Green Tea | 185° F | 3 minutes |
| White Tea | 165° F | 2 minutes |

Once the temperature is right, drop the tea bags in and let them steep. Set a timer for the appropriate steeping time.

After the timer goes off, fish the tea bags out of the pot using a strainer.

While the tea is hot, mix the sugar into the tea.

# Cool the Tea
Now that you've made your tea, it's time to cool it down. Add in the other half of the water sitting in the fridge.

**We want the tea to be as close to room temperature as we can before we add the SCOBY.**

If it's too hot, just wait. Maybe throw in some ice cubes. (Not too many though, we don't want to dilute the tea)

# SCOBY Time!
Once the tea is around room temperature, pour it into your crock. If the SCOBY is not already in the crock, then you'll need to use your hands to put it in. Don't worry, you can touch the SCOBY all you want as long as your hands are clean. Avoid using gloves which might have chemicals that SCOBYs don't like.

# Cover the Crock
SCOBYs need air to breathe, but they also attract fruit flies. To address this, cover your crock with a piece of cloth (old t-shirts work great) and secure with a rubber band.

# Wait & Taste
You're all finished! If you can, put your crock somewhere out of direct sunlight that also gets decently warm (70-85℉), since we want to encourage the SCOBY to eat.

Every now and then, uncover your crock, dip in a spoon (plastic preferably) and give your kombucha a taste. When I taste my booch, I take note of the acidity and the sweetness. Based on the taste, I make a decision to let the kombucha sit or remove the kombucha (AKA harvesting). This part is all up to personal taste, but here's a little chart about how I usually "read" the kombucha flavors.

|  | not sweet | 👌🏼 sweetness| too sweet |
|---|--------|-----|---|
| **not acidic** | 🙁 | 🕑 | 🕑 |
| 👌🏼 **acidity** | 🍹⬆️🍭 | 🍹 | 🍹⬇️🍭 |
| **too acidic** | 🍹⬇️🕑| 🍹⬇️🕑 | 🍹⬇️🍭⬇️🕑 |

🙁 something went horribly wrong  
🕑 give it some more time  
🍹 harvest the booch!  
⬆️🍭 more sugar next time  
⬇️🍭 less sugar next time  
⬇️🕑  less sitting next time

# Harvest Moon
With clean hands, take out your SCOBY from the crock. Set it on a clean plate with a little kombucha on it so your SCOBY won't dry out. Pour or scoop out the kombucha, but make sure to leave some for your next batch. Put your SCOBY back in the crock.

# To Bottle or Not To Bottle
With your freshly harvested kombucha, you can choose to drink it now (warm or cold, doesn't matter), or you can do a **second stage fermentation** by adding a bit more sugar, bottling the kombucha in an airtight container, and letting it sit for a few more days. This makes the kombucha fizzy like soda, and it's probably what you're used to drinking if you like kombucha from the store.

# Second Stage Fermentation
*Optional*
## Supplies
- A funnel (like [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0786PFKZM/ref=sspa_dk_detail_6?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B0786PFKZM&pd_rd_wg=XeUdP&pd_rd_r=9P3R0QTHBB62ABBZQ3BT&pd_rd_w=aiF1J))
- Flip-top bottles (like [these](https://www.amazon.com/Chefs-Star-CASE-Bottles-CLEAR/dp/B011SGS8U8/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1521301011&sr=1-2-spons&keywords=bottles&psc=1))

## Ingredients
- Some type of sweetener (sugar, juice, etc.)

## Steps
1. Measure out 1/4 cup of juice or 1 tablespoon of sugar per quart of kombucha.
2. Mix the sweetener into the kombucha while the SCOBY is set aside
3. Pour the kombucha into the bottles, through a fine strainer, leaving about a half inch of air
4. Close the bottles, keep out of direct sunlight
5. After a few days, put it in the fridge so the fermentation slows down
6. Once you're ready to drink it, **open it carefully over the sink** and enjoy 😌

## Play With It
If crackin' open a cold booch with the boys didn't fizzle your taste buds as much as expected, play around with the measurements of sweetener next time. The amount of available sugar, either from the initial fermenation or the secondary fermentation, will dictate how fizzy the kombucha can get. Of course, temperature and time play important roles as well. Play around with it!
