# What is Kombucha?
Kombucha is fermented tea. It's that simple.

# What is Fermentation?
Fermentation in the process of beneficial microorganisms breaking down food which humans use as a method of preparation and preservation. It's basically when friendly bacteria say, "Hey human! Let us munch on this food and we'll make it nice and yummy for you."

Humans have been fermenting food and drinks for thousands of years, and we slowly developed symbiotic relationships with these special microorganisms. They get to thrive in the controlled environments we create during the fermentation process, and in exchange they make our food and drinks yummy and magical. If you like wine, beer, or pickles, then you have already invited those friendly bacteria into your life!

# A Spectrum of Perceptions
Like any food, there are a variety of opinions about kombucha. Some people don't like the taste, while others like myself can't go a few days without craving it. Kombucha has been touted as a "health food fad" by many people who don't care for its current trendiness. If that describes you right now, that's great! Thank you for trying something new. You are amazing.

# The Benefits of Kombucha
For most people, the microorganisms in kombucha replenish gut bacteria and aide in digestion, but that's not all kombucha has to offer. For myself and many others who brew kombucha, the process of making the drink can be as rewarding as the drink itself. When I started to brew kombucha, I gradually realized that I was essentially taking care of a living being, almost like taking care of a plant or a cat. The living being I'm referring to is the SCOBY. SCOBY stands for Symbiotic Colony of Bacteria and Yeast.

# SCOBY
SCOBYs kinda look like a pancake. It's essentially a house made by the microorganisms where they can chill, hang out, and do bacteria stuff.

Each brewing container (AKA crock) needs exactly one SCOBY. After each round of brewing, a new layer will form on top and the SCOBY will grow.

# Getting a SCOBY
In order to start making kombucha, you have to find someone who is willing to give you a piece of their SCOBY. I got mine from a University of Michigan medical student that I found through Craigslist. Try talking to friends, searching Craigslist, and asking around at local coffee shops. I've never met a kombucha brewer unwilling to share their SCOBY.

Don't be afraid. Your SCOBY may not win a beauty pageant, but as long as you give it some love every couple weeks, you two will get along. They are actually pretty resilient. You can leave SCOBYs alone for months without any issues, as long as it is submerged in kombucha.

# SCOBY Health
 You have to take care of your SCOBY because no SCOBY means no kombucha! Make sure to...

- Give it sugar to eat and tea to hang out in
- Make sure it doesn't get too hot (anything above 85℉)
- Handle it with clean hands in a clean environment
- Avoid using metal around the SCOBY
- Give it a home in a glass or ceramic container
- Wash its home (the jar or crock) every so often

SCOBYs are incredibly tough. It's very rare for mold to grow, but it can happen
if your SCOBY is treated really badly and most of the bacteria die. Without the bacteria, there is no defense against mold. If you see any fuzzy mold, you sadly must throw your SCOBY away. It's ok! There will always be more SCOBYs. Just try harder next time, for the poor SCOBY's sake.

Many cautious beginners mistake SCOBY coloration for mold. SCOBY colors can range from very dark brown to light beige. Mold is usually white, blue, or green. If there is no fuzzy mold, your SCOBY is probably just chillin.

# Setting Up a Supportive Environment
A common question after making a first batch of kombucha is, "How long do I have to wait until I have yummy kombucha?" Here are a few factors you should consider.

### 1. Temperature
Warmer temperatures means more fermentation. The ideal temp zone is around 80℉. Be careful not to expose the SCOBY to temperatures above 85℉, or the bacteria might start jumping ship.

### 2. Surface Area
The SCOBY needs air to breathe, and the more tea exposed to the air, the better. Crocks that have square-like dimensions are ideal. Try not to use a crock that's tall and skinny.

### 3. Sugar
Intuitively, the more sugar available to the SCOBY, the more it can eat. As the sugar is broken down, the bacteria produce acidic compounds, giving kombucha its signature, vinegar-ish taste.

### 4. Liquid
Always make sure your SCOBY is submerged in liquid (either sugary tea or kombucha). This may seem obvious, but sometimes after a harvest, the small amount of kombucha left can evaporate from the crock, leaving the SCOBY without any food.

# Giving Your SCOBY a Rest
If you decide to take a break from brewing, just make sure the SCOBY has a good amount of kombucha to hang out in (it will evaporate over time), and it should have no problems at all. After every month of inactivity, pour in some cane sugar to keep the bacteria happy and well fed.
