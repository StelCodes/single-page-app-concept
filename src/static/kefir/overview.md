# Kefir
Kefir (keh-fear) commonly refers to a family of fermented drinks made using probiotic "grains" that are symbiotic cultures of bacteria and yeast. It's like kombucha, except the kefir grains ferment different types of drinks. While kombucha is made from sugary tea, kefir is made from sugary water or milk.

# Water kefir
Water kefir (also called tibicos) ferments much faster than kombucha and is equally delicious. In my experience, water kefir yields nutty and complex flavors.
